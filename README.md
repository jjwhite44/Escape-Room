# Escape Room

During summer 2024, I worked with Dr. Casper Harteveld and Dr. Seth Cooper at Northeastern University to develop the beginnings of an escape room that can function in virtual reality, augmented reality, and on a computer screen. Dr. Harteveld and Dr. Cooper are collaborating on a multi-modal escape room project to serve as a foundation for answering a number of research questions related to the use of AI agents and technology in education. For me, this was a 10-week opportunity to learn Unity from scratch and build concrete skills while working on my first project.

Included in this repository are the `Assets`, `Packages`, and `ProjectSettings` from the escape room project.
